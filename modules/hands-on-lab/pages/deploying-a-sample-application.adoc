#  Deploying a sample application

== Deploying a Sample Application

In this section, we will guide you through the process of deploying a simple "Welcome" application on your OpenShift cluster. This hands-on activity will help you understand the basic steps involved in containerized application deployment using OpenShift.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure that you have:

1. An OpenShift cluster set up successfully. Refer to the 'Setting up an OpenShift cluster' lab for guidance.
2. The `oc` CLI tool installed and configured to interact with your OpenShift cluster.
3. Basic understanding of containerization and Kubernetes concepts.

### Step 1: Create a New Project

A project in OpenShift is equivalent to a namespace in Kubernetes. It's a way to partition resources among users or teams. To create a new project, run the following command:

```bash
oc new-project <project_name>
```

Replace `<project_name>` with a name of your choice. For instance:

```bash
oc new-project welcome-app-project
```

To verify the newly created project, use:

```bash
oc project
```

This should display the name of the project you just created.

### Step 2: Prepare the Sample Application

For this lab, we'll use a simple Node.js application that displays "Welcome to OpenShift!" when accessed. You can find the source code in the `welcome-app` directory.

The application consists of:

- `welcome.js`: A simple Node.js script that responds with "Welcome to OpenShift!" when accessed.
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions to build a Docker image for the Node.js application.

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the `welcome-app` directory and build the Docker image:

```bash
cd welcome-app
oc new-build --strategy=docker --name=welcome-app
```

This command tells OpenShift to create a new build configuration named `welcome-app` using the Docker strategy. OpenShift will then automatically trigger a build based on this configuration.

### Step 4: Deploy the Application

Once the build is successful, you can deploy the application using the following command:

```bash
oc new-app welcome-app
```

This command creates a new application using the previously built
